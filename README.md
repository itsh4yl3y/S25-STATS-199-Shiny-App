# UCLA Stats Calculator

UCLA Stats Calculator is an R Shiny web app that makes critical-value calculations simple and intuitive, while also serving as a general-purpose tool for performing common statistical tests and confidence intervals. 

Key features: 
- Live, reactive output: results update instantly as you type; no “Calculate” button needed
- Clean summary tables: every procedure produces a concise table showing the null and alternative hypothesis, sample estimates, p‑value, and test conclusions at α = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10
- One‑click options: easily toggle confidence intervals, choose between proportion vs. raw successes, overlay the standard normal curve, and more
- Student‑friendly interface: intuitive inputs, UCLA colors (#2774AE), and a theme that scales nicely to phones for in‑lab use
